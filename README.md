# trofiApp

An app for inspiring homecooks who want to track their culinary growth by logging dishes and storing new and favorite recipes to foster continous improvment and enjoyment on their culinary journy 

## Background 

In the culinary world, memories and experiences are often intertwined with the dishes we savor. Whether it’s a homemade meal crafted with love, a gourmet dish from a high-end restaurant, or a simple comfort food that hits the spot, every dish tells a story. Trofi is designed to capture these stories, providing a seamless way to log, rate, and reflect on your gastronomic journey.


## The Idea

The inception of Trofi stemmed from a simple yet profound need: the desire to remember and cherish the diverse dishes encountered over time. Many food enthusiasts, home cooks, and culinary explorers often find themselves recalling a specific meal but struggling to remember its details—its taste, appearance, and the emotions it evoked. This app bridges that gap, offering an intuitive platform to document each culinary experience.

## Core Features 

1. Dish Logging: Capture your dishes with ease by snapping a photo, linking it to a date and location, and adding ratings based on taste and aesthetics. Optionally, include detailed descriptions and personal notes to enrich each entry.

2. Calendar View: Navigate through a calendar to revisit specific dishes enjoyed on particular dates, making it effortless to track your culinary timeline.

3. Dish Album: All logged dishes are organized in one accessible place, allowing you to browse through your culinary creations and experiences with a single touch.

4. Recipe Browsing and Importing: Explore recipes from the web and import them into the app with links and optional images. Maintain a "Want to Try" page for recipes you’re eager to experiment with.

5. Insights and Analytics: Gain insights into your culinary journey with parameters such as average rating growth, highest and lowest-rated dishes, repeated dishes with improved ratings, and a breakdown of home-cooked versus restaurant meals.

6. Achievements and Notifications: Earn badges and awards for logging streaks and the number of dishes logged. Receive reminders to log new dishes and suggestions of previously high-rated dishes when you’re unsure of what to cook next.

7. Social Media Integration: Export dish entries, including titles and photos, as posts for social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, sharing your culinary adventures with friends and followers.



## Why It Matters


Memory Aid: Trofi serves as a digital memory bank for your culinary adventures, allowing you to recall specific dishes with ease.

Community and Sharing: Share your creations with the app’s community, fostering inspiration and connection as you explore what others are cooking and enjoying.
